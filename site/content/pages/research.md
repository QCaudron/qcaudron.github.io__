### Measles in Small Populations


The dynamics of measles are well studied in large populations, where the assumption of state-space continuity in differential equations holds well. Small, isolated populations admit very different dynamics, with the disease typically going extinct, before being reintroduced by immigration. In Iceland, Bornholm, and the Faroe Islands, <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/102/20141125.full-text.pdf">we showed</a> that, despite highly stochastic dynamics, the final sizes of epidemics can be predicted to some level of confidence. We are currently working on a slightly different setting : small towns in the UK, where populations are small, but towns are much more highly connected to large cities.


### Computational Histopathology

I develop computer vision methods for computational histopathology, currently applied to Soay sheep liver samples. With [Romain Garnier](https://sites.google.com/site/immunoecologist/) and [Andrea Graham](http://www.princeton.edu/~algraham/people_agraham.htm), we have collected the largest dataset of histology images, with nearly twenty thousand high-resolution images, and are working to quickly and robustly extract quantitative structural and textural information that is biologically interesting to pathologists and ecologists.



### Avian Influenza

With [Mike Tildesley](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/vet/people/michael.tildesley), I'm looking into modelling H5N1 in Bangladesh. We have extensive spatial data, and are studying how H5N1 propagates between farms.
