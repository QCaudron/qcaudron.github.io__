I'm a data scientist and lapsed physicist. My interests are in machine learning, signal and image processing, and theoretical biology.

### I like thinking about methods and algorithms for solving complex problems.

I work for the [Market Builder](https://cbredev.com) Group within [CBRE](http://www.cbre.com), the world's largest commercial real estate services company. We're a data analytics team, building business solutions around vast quantites of data using open-source technologies.  

Prior to joining CBRE, I built mathematical and statistical models of disease dynamics at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu), as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb). I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience from the [Centre for Complexity Science](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/complexity) at the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk) in 2013. I was affiliated with the departments of [Physics](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/physics), [Computer Science](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/dcs), and [Biological Sciences](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/lifesci), and was part of the [Computational Biology and Bioimaging Group](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/combi). Before that, I received an MSc in Complexity Science in 2009, and a BSc in [Chemistry](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/chemistry) in 2008. I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland and Russia.
