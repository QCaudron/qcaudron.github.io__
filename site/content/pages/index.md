I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu). My interests are in mathematical and computational biology, signal and image processing, and machine learning.

### I like thinking about methods and algorithms for solving complex problems.

I'm a postdoc with [Bryan Grenfell](http://scholar.princeton.edu/grenfellgroup/people) in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb). I draw from methods in mathematics, physics, and computer science, and apply them to problems in biology, specifically in the areas of infectious disease epidemiology and ecology.

I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience from the [Centre for Complexity Science](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/complexity) at the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk) in 2013. I was affiliated with the departments of [Physics](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/physics), [Computer Science](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/dcs), and [Biological Sciences](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/lifesci), and was part of the [Computational Biology and Bioimaging Group](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/combi). Prior to this, I received an MSc in Complexity Science in 2009, and a BSc in [Chemistry](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/chemistry) in 2008. In March of 2013, I moved to Princeton. I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland and Russia.
