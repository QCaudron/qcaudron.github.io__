I'm a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. My interests are in mathematical and computational biology, signal and image processing, and machine learning.

### I like thinking about methods and algorithms for solving complex problems.

I'm a postdoc with <a href="http://scholar.princeton.edu/grenfellgroup/people">Bryan Grenfell</a> in the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/eeb">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>.  I draw from methods in mathematics, physics, and computer science, and apply them to problems in biology, specifically in the areas of infectious disease epidemiology and ecology.

After obtaining my undergraduate degree in [Chemistry](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/chemistry) at the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk) in 2008, I joined the [Centre for Complexity Science](http://go.warwick.ac.uk/complexity) and obtained an MSc in Complexity Science, followed by a PhD in Mathematical Neuroscience in 2013. In March of that year, I moved to [Princeton University](http://princeton.edu). I was born in France, and have also lived in the USA, the UK, Poland and Russia.
